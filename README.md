# booru-styles
I have no idea how a git workflow works, I probably should have forked this or something. Code is from Seedmanc and all I did was edit like two lines to fix how images get resized while using their Booru Augmentation Script. Is there a simpler way to do this than making your own repo? Probably! I have no idea how though.
